# TkinterSortVisualizer
A sorting algorithm visualizer built with lots of different options for sorting algorithms, inputs and speeds.
## Motivation
Around 2022, I developed a special interest in sorting algorithms. I watched many YouTube videos that visualized sorting algorithms, and used pitch to 'audify' each number in the arrays being sorted. I saw lots of different sorting algorithm visualizers and visualization videos, all with their own features that I liked and disliked. 

I wanted to create a sorting algorithm visualizer myself, as a challenge. And I wanted it to be the perfect balance of all the visualizers I had seen in the internet. That's why I included many options for algorithms, inputs and speeds.

Currently, this project isn't complete. It contains many algorithm-related features, and most of them are complete, but it still lacks a lot of UI features, and the sound has some significant problems. If you want to contribute, I'd love to see your ideas!
## Installation
First, make sure you have Python 3 installed. I recommend Python3.9 or higher.

Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GABETROLL/TkinterSortVisualizer.git
$ cd TkinterSortVisualizer/
```
Install the required Python modules:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
(or replace ``pip3`` with ``pip`` for Windows)
## Usage
Running the program:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
(or replace ``python3`` with ``python`` for Windows)
